# Unetiq Assignment

Please note that you must have `node` installed in your environment.

Install node-modules first.
```bash
npm run install
```
You can __skip the step below__ as I have included a build already. But
if you want to create another fresh build run:
```bash
npm run build
```
The above command will create two folders __build__ and __dist__.

Now you can simply host the application ( you must have node installed ). 
```bash
npm run start:server
```
Now you can access application at ``http://localhost:3001``
